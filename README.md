# Workdayschedule
WASNT ABLE TO FULFIL THE MAJOR PARTS OF THE USER ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA. 

I WANT TO CONTINUE WORKING ON THIS HW BEFORE THE COMPLETION OF THE BOOTCAMP.

I was able to get parts of this hw done, but still havent figured out how to connect the timeblocks to the current hour. I will figure this out eventually.
I also need to figure out how to make the user input display after refresh. 

I was able to connect the user input into the local storage, and have the UI matching the Acceptance criteria. However due to the lack of time, i am submitting an unfinished product.
